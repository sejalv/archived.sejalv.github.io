        Hello there! I'm Sejal, a tech professional and a hobby writer.
        <br><br>
        Here, you'll find a collection of my musings on tech insights, analytical perspectives, and personal narratives on life and shared human experiences.

        In my professional space, I currently focus on Data and Product Analytics, with an interest in developing Data/ML products for Social Good. 
        With over 12 years of Tech industry experience, my expertise lies in Software Engineering and Data Platforms within the Healthcare, Digital Health & Wellbeing, and e-commerce sectors.
        <br><br>
        In my personal time, I explore themes of feminism, satire, wellbeing, and mindfulness through writing, reading, cinema, and meditation.
